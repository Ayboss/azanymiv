            1. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
          </h4>
          <p className="text-[32px] font-light leading-[46px] mb-10">
            One of the most effective ways to secure your account is by enabling
            two-factor authentication (2FA). This feature adds an extra layer of
            protection by requiring not just your password, but also a secondary
            form of verification—usually a code sent to your mobile
            device—before you can log in or approve a transaction.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-[32px] font-bold leading-[46px] mb-10">
            How 2FA Protects You:
          </h4>
          <p className="text-[32px] font-light leading-[46px] mb-10">
            Prevents unauthorized access even if someone manages t&gt; obtain
            your password. Adds a time-sensitive step that ensures only you can
            access your account, making it far more secure than using a password
            alone. <br />
            At My Island Visa, we make it easy to activate 2FA, and we highly
            recommend that all users take advantage of this feature for their
            own protection.

            2. Verify Recipient Information Thoroughly
          </h4>
          <p className="text-[32px] font-light leading-[46px] mb-10">
            A common mistake that can lead to funds being sent to the wrong
            recipient is inputting incorrect information. To avoid this, it's
            essential to double-check the recipient's details before confirming
            any transaction. Even small mistakes like a misspelled name or an
            incorrect bank account number can lead to delays or even lost funds
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-[32px] font-bold leading-[46px] mb-10">
            What to Verify:
          </h4>
          <p className="text-[32px] font-light leading-[46px] mb-10">
            Full Name: Ensure the recipient's name matches their official ID or
            bank account exactly. Account Number/Details: Double-check bank
            account or mobile money details. Country and Currency: Make sure
            you're sending funds in the correct currency for the recipient's
            location. <br />
            Taking a few extra moments to review these details can save you from
            unnecessary headaches and delays
